# pyrdragdisk

PR-drag model for debris discs originating in a planetesimal belt.


## Overview

`pyrdragdisk` is a Python package designed to model circumstellar debris/dust disks
that are generated by the Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag effect 
transporting material inward from an outer planetesimal belt.

The package allows for the computation of:

- Spatial distribution of dust in the disk
- Temperature and size distribution of dust grains
- Disk thermal emission and spectral energy distribution (SED)
- Astrophysical scenes of the disk for arbitrary viewing geometries


The core of this package is an implementation of the analytical model of 
[Rigley & Wyatt (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa2029)
which computes the distribution of dust in the debris disk.
It then combines this disk model with particle [optical properties](https://github.com/rigilkent/optprops) 
to simulate the disk thermal emission.
Astrophysical scenes of the disk for arbitrary viewing geometries are computed using the
['rave' package](https://github.com/yinuohan/Rave).

## Usage

See the `examples` directory for detailed usage examples.

The package provides several key classes for modeling debris disks:

```python
from pyrdragdisk import Disk, Particles, Belt, RadialBins, Star

# Initialize the necessary objects
star = Star(...)
prtl = Particles(...)
belt = Belt(...)
rbin = RadialBins(...)

# Create and compute disk model
disk = Disk.make_disk(belt=belt, prtl=prtl, rbin=rbin, star=star)

# Calculate observables
disk.calculate_surface_brightness(wav=23.0, prtl=prtl)
```

## Installation

This package requires the `optprops` package which is currently only available on GitHub. Install dependencies first:

```bash
# Install optprops dependency
git clone https://github.com/rigilkent/optprops.git
cd optprops
pip install .

# Install pyrdragdisk
git clone https://github.com/rigilkent/pyrdragdisk.git
cd pyrdragdisk
pip install .
```
